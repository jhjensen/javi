I am experimenting with uncrustify, and havn't been able to configure it for a few ways
I like to format my code:

I like to double indent the following:

   public Object foo(int arg1, Object arg2, int count,
         int arg3, int arg4, boolean arg5                          // double indent
         int arg6, Object arg7, boolean arg8) {              // double indent
      switch (arg1) {                                                      // single indent


but single indent:

x =whatever
   +whaterver ;

and I don't see how to do that.  I think I want a rule that says "double indent continuations that
end in a {, but single indent others.

I also have a problem with conditional assignments.

I like to indent them like this:

x = cond1
   ? cond2
      ? val1
      : val2
   : val3;

This parallels "if then else" indentation, with the indent set to 3.

uncrustify seems to insist on lining them up like this

x = cond1
      ? cond2
      ? val1
      : val2
      : val3;

At the least I would like it to be able to ignore these lines.
