
for the pop up when a file is modified on disk:
There is a deadlock when that popup appears, but before it is filled out.
There is probably a lock that needs to be taken to prevent a ta command from holding the lock
Add display difference of file and editor file and file on disk similar to opening a file button to the file changed popup.
Add permanently ignore file difference button.
Add stop editing button - if the file is modified there should be save and stop editing
The stream interface needs to have those choices as well.

debug the following novel stacktrace:

java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot read field "x" because "pos" is null


Better icon.

display last line of output on statusbar after mk command completes.
This is a harder than it sounds.  The line in positionIOC that displays this
            UI.reportMessage(this + "complete " + errcount + " results");
Has no access to the previous line.

Is there something like clang-format for java? If so integrate it.

diredit similar to vi
Start with display of directory, entering sub directories.  
Delete files, sorting by size.  display size including dir size like ncdu
Create file

documentation, help system, binding list

integrate LSP and/or tree-sitter.  The first use case would be to replace/improve over ctags/mkid.

Integrate copilot/AI.

integrate git. Magit might be an inspiration. 

Improve test coverage.
Possibly using the Stream
Create a methodology for  testing ui.
convert testcases to Junit 

enhance make dist: verify that everthing is checked in, built and and tests run,  create a versioned jar and create a tag.

Work on eliminating the SuppressWarnings directives.

improve vt100
in vt100 should really detect our current charset from the terminal
multiple ssh

JS.java should add charset detection?

revisit all uses of string "UTF-8";

When writing file need to copy permissions.

add safeWrite to fdes?

It would be very good in PersistantStack.push to move the flush to close, and do it occasionally
Also BadBackupFile should inherit from IOException

refactor AwtInterface into separate files?

get rid of getnext?

findbug cmd not working, maybe update to other linter.  Spotbugs?

lock access to .dmp2

multiple shells.  It would be good to allow multiple shells to run,

improve remote ctag.

improve local/remote mkid

redo PersitantStack->RanFileArray

jython if it ever supports python3

fix cmd line.

use Iterable<OType> in EditContainer instead of Object Array
EditContainer Container/Iterator
EditVec could be Container?

IoConverter could be Generator/ Iterator<OType>?

chinese
edit file list

new view from oldstuff?

done :

when rebuilding kill the old build if it is still running?


I would like a popup when a currently open file is changed on the filesystem.
I suspect it can be tied into the EventQueue idler interface.

   :asdf\r up arrow right arrow down arrow(down arrow isnt fixing posx)
   fix ^g problem
   fix tag waiting for file read problem
   fix using the file version requires a repaint(maxline removeal)
   Remake vi.exe(python?)

   fix \r\n so It stays the same for files
   make all positions have a FileDescriptor
   O sometimes pukes
   ex move, copy  are wrong
 

____________________________________________________________
Create todo.md based on todo.txt, with any clarifications possible.
Integrate Bugs.Md and Improvements.md into todo.md
items in todo.txt are paragraphs separated by empty lines.
ignore everything after the "done :" line.
If you are unsure what is meant by some of the items make a note of the issue in the output and move on.
Some of these items are old, and I have forgotten what the meant.
Each item will be a future prompt for AI, so try to be complete.

____________________________________________________________
Rename tmp directory to ai, a directory that ai can use for whatever purpose is useful.

Analyze all the code and add javadoc comments.
The primary purpose of the javadoc is to do to future AI analysis.
be consise, but include any information useful the that purpose.
Modify the makefile to create javadoc.
Create javadoc for the project and add a pointer to it for agents.md
Goals for the javadoc are:
- consistent docstrings give the model names, roles, params, and invariants to anchor its reasoning; clarifies intent over ad-hoc comments; makes autocomplete and search more reliable.
- public APIs, shared interfaces, data models, and tricky invariants deserve precise Javadoc (with brief + detailed descriptions). Internal glue/obvious getters can stay light.
- focus on the 20–30% most-used or most-risky surfaces
- Agents can grep/search for function signatures + purpose without reading entire implementations.
-  Pre/postconditions, param constraints, thread-safety notes, and ownership semantics are exactly what models need to avoid subtle bugs.
- Consistent vocabulary: Standardized tags (@param, @return, @throws) are easier to parse than free-form prose scattered in code.
Any uncertainties mark with UNCLEAR, don't ask.

Then create a plan markdown file for each todo item.  
These files should be in the ai directory.
Each one should be a separate file and include an indication of how easy and desirable the fix is.
The rateing and a link should be included in todo.md
Any uncertainties mark with UNCLEAR, don't ask.
it is likely that the todo.md entry will be modified.
The difficulty may be reassesed.
The todo entry should end up as a high level summary of the proposed change


____________________________________________________________

For the items in todo.md create a subagent to work on items using the linked plans.

prioritize high priority, easy tasks first.

Each subagent will create a git branch and worktree to implement the item and test it. 
worktrees should be in the ai directory.
Changes should include relevant javadoc comments, and tests.  Unit tests and tests that use StreamInterface will be useful.
Unit tests should be implemented with junit.
If the subagent is blocked needing feedback update the plan document with what feed back it needs and continue

As each sub agent completes the main agent should report it and check for git conflicts in other completed branches.
