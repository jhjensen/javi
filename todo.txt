
for the pop up when a file is modified on disk:
There is a deadlock when that popup appears, but before it is filled out.
There is probably a lock that needs to be taken to prevent a ta command from holding the lock
Add display difference of file and editor file and file on disk similar to opening a file button to the file changed popup.
Add permanently ignore file difference button.
Add stop editing button - if the file is modified there should be save and stop editing
The stream interface needs to have those choices as well.

debug the following novel stacktrace:

java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot read field "x" because "pos" is null


Better icon.

display last line of output on statusbar after mk command completes.
This is a harder than it sounds.  The line in positionIOC that displays this
            UI.reportMessage(this + "complete " + errcount + " results");
Has no access to the previous line.

Is there something like clang-format for java? If so integrate it.

diredit similar to vi
Start with display of directory, entering sub directories.  
Delete files, sorting by size.  display size including dir size like ncdu
Create file

documentation, help system, binding list

integrate LSP and/or tree-sitter.  The first use case would be to replace/improve over ctags/mkid.

Integrate copilot/AI.

integrate git. Magit might be an inspiration. 

Improve test coverage.
Possibly using the Stream
Create a methodology for  testing ui.
convert testcases to Junit 

enhance make dist: verify that everthing is checked in, built and and tests run,  create a versioned jar and create a tag.

Work on eliminating the SuppressWarnings directives.

improve vt100
in vt100 should really detect our current charset from the terminal
multiple ssh

JS.java should add charset detection?

revisit all uses of string "UTF-8";

When writing file need to copy permissions.

add safeWrite to fdes?

It would be very good in PersistantStack.push to move the flush to close, and do it occasionally
Also BadBackupFile should inherit from IOException

refactor AwtInterface into separate files?

get rid of getnext?

findbug cmd not working, maybe update to other linter.  Spotbugs?

lock access to .dmp2

multiple shells.  It would be good to allow multiple shells to run,

improve remote ctag.

improve local/remote mkid

redo PersitantStack->RanFileArray

jython if it ever supports python3

fix cmd line.

use Iterable<OType> in EditContainer instead of Object Array
EditContainer Container/Iterator
EditVec could be Container?

IoConverter could be Generator/ Iterator<OType>?

chinese
edit file list

new view from oldstuff?

done :

when rebuilding kill the old build if it is still running?


I would like a popup when a currently open file is changed on the filesystem.
I suspect it can be tied into the EventQueue idler interface.
